# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing.

You can contribute in one of three ways:

1. File bug reports using the issue tracker.
2. Answer questions or fix bugs on the issue tracker.
3. Contribute new features or update the wiki.

# New features

Any new code contributions must be accompanied by unit tests where applicable.

All code contributions must go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being merged.
This is to ensure proper review of all the code.

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send a pull request.

### Rules

- **[Symfony Coding Standard]** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `composer lint`
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
